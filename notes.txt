Structure
    put a post in a directory, run again, don't list each post
    - you have to have an indicator for template
    - indicator for which directory to point to
    - show how many posts... [5]
    - Index? Archives?

Don't forget archive sections, how do we define those?

- chose yaml or json
- Figure out how to create dynamic number of elements on a page with mustache template
        --- https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html
            --- Sections or non-empty lists???
- css/looks/default templates
- can we do syntax highlighting in html

1. default dict
    - solidify structure
    - chose yaml/json
    - prettyprint structure (graphviz)
2. functions that take dicts -> return new dicts
3. gensite(dictionary)
